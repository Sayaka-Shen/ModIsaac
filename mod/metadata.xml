    For now this mods add curse item with their graphics. I don't think the mod works with other mod so just in case deactivate the mod that add items.

List Of Items :

- Curse Of Death
- Curse Of The Devil
- Curse Of The Empress
- Curse Of The Fool
- Curse Of The Hanged Man
- Curse Of The Magician
- Curse Of The World

We were two, my friend Louis who designed everything and myself GaÃ«tan I programmed all the lua.
